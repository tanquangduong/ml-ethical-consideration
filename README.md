Ethical consideration in machine learning 


## Ethical considerations in machine learning
- Classification algorithms, when used on society, determine how individuals and groups are shaped and managed.
- Algorithms, when used in recommendation engines, can match resumes to job seekers, both individuals and groups. 
- Data mining algorithms are used to mine information from users and are provided to decision-makers and governments. 
- Machine learning algorithms are starting to be used by governments to grant or deny visas to applicants.

## Algorithm Analysis
- Inconclusive evidence: limited available evidence, irrelevant evidence
- Traceability: Disconnection between the training phase and testing phase
- Misguided evidence: Garbage-In, Garbage-Out(GIGO)
- Unfair outcomes: Harming vulnerable communities and groups that already at a disadvantage

## Reduce bias in models
- General biases based on gender, race, sexual orientation
- All bias in algirithm is, directly or indirectly, due to human bias.
- The trickiest part of reducing bias is to first identify and locate unconscious bias

## Tackle NP-hard problems
- Simplifying the problem 
- Customizing a well-known solution to a similar problem 
- Using a probabilistic method

## When to use algorithm? Which criterion should we keep in mind?
- Cost: Can use justify the cost related to the effort of implementing the algorithm? 
- Time: Does our solution make the overall process more efficient than simpler alternatives? 
- Accuracy: Does our solution produce more accurate results than simpler alternatives?

## To choose the right algorithm, answer the following questions:
- Can we simplify the problem by making assumptions? 
- How will we evaluate our algorithm? What are the key metrics? 
- How will it be deployed and used? 
- Does it need to be explainable? 
- Do we understand the three important non-functional requirements—security, performance, and availability? 
- Is there any expected deadline?

## Four criteria to classify an event as a black swan event
- First, once the event has happened, for observers it must be a mind-blowing surprise, for example, dropping the atom bomb on Hiroshima.

- The event should be a blockbuster—a disruptor and a major one, such as the outbreak of the Spanish Flu.

- Once the event has happened and the dust has settled, data scientists who were part of the observer group should realize that actually it was not that much of a surprise. Observers never paid attention to some important clues. Had they the capacity and initiative, the black swan event could have been predicted. For example, the Spanish Flu outbreak had some leads that were known to be ignored before it became a global outbreak. Also, the Manhattan Project was run for years before the atomic bomb was actually dropped on Hiroshima. People in the observer group just could not connect the dots.

- When it happened, while the observers of the black swan event got the surprise of their lifetime, there may be some people for whom it may not have been a surprise at all. For example, for scientists working for years to develop the atomic bomb, the use of atomic power was never a surprise but an expected event.
